# Rational Behaviors for Reactive Agents in NetLogo

This repository contains an academic project designed to simulate **rational behaviors in reactive agents**. Developed as part of the *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course, the project focuses on programming agents to efficiently clean a obstacle-filled environment using the NetLogo platform.

## Project Overview

The simulation explores how reactive agents can behave rationally to achieve specific objectives in a constrained environment. The agents are tasked with:
- Collecting and depositing waste.
- Managing energy levels by recharging at designated stations.
- Navigating around obstacles efficiently.

The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of their behaviors and improve their performance through strategic modifications.

## Key Features
### 1. Base Model
The foundational implementation includes:
- Reactive decision-making based on immediate perceptions.
- Basic energy management and task prioritization.
- Basic waste collection and disposal mechanisms.

### 2. Improved Model
Enhancements to the base model focus on:
- Optimizing navigation.
- Strategic energy management with preemptive recharging.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Install NetLogo and open the simulation file.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust parameters such as:
   - Number of agents
   - Waste density
   - Number of obstacles
3. **Execution**: Run the simulation to observe agent behaviors and outcomes.

## Experiments and Results
The project includes a detailed experimental analysis of agent performance under varying configurations. Key experiments evaluate:
- The impact of energy levels and waste capacity on agent efficiency.
- Navigation efficiency in environments with high obstacle density.
